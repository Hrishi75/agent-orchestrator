/**
 * Idle sleep prevention.
 *
 * macOS: spawns `caffeinate -i -w <pid>` to hold an idle-sleep prevention
 * assertion for the lifetime of the watched process. caffeinate releases the
 * assertion automatically when that pid exits.
 *
 * Linux: spawns `systemd-inhibit --what=idle --mode=block ...` wrapping a
 * tiny shell watchdog that polls the watched pid every 5s and exits when the
 * process is gone — releasing the inhibitor lock the same way `-w <pid>`
 * does on macOS. No-op on non-systemd systems (containers without
 * systemd-inhibit, WSL1, etc.) — the async spawn `error` event is swallowed.
 *
 * No-op on Windows and other unsupported platforms.
